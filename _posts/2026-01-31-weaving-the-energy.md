Weaving the Energy: 예술로에너지하기 is an artistic research project that explores the concrete flow of electricity as the subject of artistic thinking and practice. The electricity we take for granted serves as the foundation of artistic creation while also being a key mediator permeating technology, environment, and climate crisis. This project originated from the questions: "How can art intervene in energy issues?" and "What artistic methods can reframe electricity?"
