<p><b>
My name is Mina.<br/>
Currently I'm studying for a master's degree in <a href="http://fmi.academieminerva.nl/Programs/MADtech" target="blank">MADtech(media, art, design and technology)</a> at Frank Mohr Institute in Groningen, Netherlands.<br/>
Before that, I majored in <a href="http://sociology.snu.ac.kr/eng" target="blank">Sociology</a> and <a href="http://isc.snu.ac.kr/" target="blank">Information Science and Culture</a> in the undergraduate in Seoul, Korea.
</b></p>

<p><b>
I'm interested in the interaction between human and digital technology, taking sociological point of view. I like looking into not only new technological development but also the things left behind as it proceeds. <br/>
I'm working on 'electronic wastes' these days by seeking the usefulness and new value of abandoned, useless and outdated electronic rubbish.
